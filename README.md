# jike_calendar

It is a Mac calendar app built with Electron. The idea comes from the Jike desk calendar, which is funny and looks pretty.

Not long ago, I bulit a widget on iOS with [JSBox](). If interested, see [Jike Calendar]().

This repository again copy the same idea and transfer it from iOS to MacOS (desktop) using Election. The design of this app combines the desk calendar and the iOS implementation, looks much more similar to the real one, and much easier for desktop to use.

Two important points are kept also.

- Small font size is used to display the "useless" string -- date.
- Display quote post by users randomly.

If you don't have the real Jike desk calendar but love it and want one, you should take a try.
